# Craftbeerpi4 Actor Plugin that switched Actor off depending on GPIO input state

## THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION

- Functions:
	- This Plugin can switch off an actor depending on a GPIO input state

- Parameters:
	- Actor: The Actor that has to be switched off
	- GPIO: The GPIO that s used as input for a high / low signal
	- GPIOstate: High or low. If set to high, the Actor will be siwtched off, when the GPIO turns from low to high. If set to low, it'll work from high to low
	- Notification: If set to Yes, a notification will be sent, when the GPIO triggers the actor
	
- Installation:
	- log in via ssh 
	- clone from the GIT repo
	- sudo pip install ./GPIODependentActor
	- cbpi add cbpi4-GPIODependentActor
	
- Changelog:
	- 04.09.21: Initial commit
	
- Known Problems:
	- Not tested on my system as I have no GPIO inputs (User confirmation required) -> Therefore ALPHA version
	- When GPIO switches off the actor, the state for this actor is not updated in the UI. The dependent actor state is updated. Further investigation required for fix
